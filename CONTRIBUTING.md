## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the open source edition of COLABRIQ's decentralised knowledge graph.

Please read the following Code of Conduct, Contributor Agreement, Questions and Bugs Process, Responsible Disclosure Process and Pull Request Process and follow them in all your interactions with the project.

See the README.md in this repository for further information on the nature of the project and consult LICENSE.md for the agreement under which this code may be licensed.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team through contact details listed on maintainers' GitHub profiles. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Contributor Agreement

Contributing code, documentation, issues, bugs, releases or any other files to this repository shall constitute full and unconditional agreement and acceptance of this Contributor License Agreement, for all your present and future contributions to this project.

You certify that your contributions are either:

- Created in whole or in part by you and that you have the right to submit the contributions under our designated license; or
- Based upon previous work that to the best of your knowledge is covered under an appropriate open source license and you have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by you, under our designated license; or
- Provided directly to you by some other person(s) who certified (1) or (2) and you have not modified them.

You understand and agree that the project and your contributions are public and that a record of the contributions (including all metadata and personal information you submit with them) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the project’s policies and the requirements of its license where they are relevant.

You are granting contributions to the project under the terms of the license as noted in the project’s repository, irrevocably and in perpetuity. Except for the license granted herein to the project, you reserve all right, title, and interest in and to your contributions.

## Questions and Bugs Process

Keeping this discussion close to the actual code is important, because it saves both the development process as well as the reason why certain decisions were made, which is vital institutional memory for new developer to learn from. Emailing questions is undesirable because the organization as a whole does not have access to this information, even though everybody could benefit from it.

On GitHub, these discussions can take place in Issues.

When opening an issue, please provide as much context as possible. You can link to specific files or lines of code. When working with a release, please also list the version you are using.

The maintainers will respond as quickly as possible.

## Responsible Disclosure Process

This project aims to stay secure for everyone. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in this code, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We will give you appropriate credit for reporting confirmed issues.

To report an potential exploit please open an issue on GitHub but do not immediately disclose your findings. The maintainers will provide a timely response with further contact details where we can safely work together in a responsible manner to assess the severity and create a fix before you publish.

## Pull Request Process

When contributing code to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository. You can then work with us via pull requests to make your changes.

Please update the README.md and other documentation with all relevant changes, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters. Increase the version numbers as necessary to reflect minor or major (breaking) changes. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

Please work constructively with other maintainers and contributors at all times and maintain the standards and behaviours set out in the Code of Conduct.

1. Ensure your changes pass all unit tests and check for CI results
2. Open a pull request and wait for others to review your work
3. Be prepared to take constructive criticism and suggestions 
4. Your code will be merged by a maintainer when it's reviewed!
